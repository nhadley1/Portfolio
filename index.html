                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                I am a graduate of Walsh University with a degree in Computer Science with an
                emphasis in programming, where I was awarded the Outstanding Senior Computer Science Student
                Award in 2020. I enjoy being challenged and thinking critically and abstractly to build efficient,
                useful, and user-friendly software.

            <h1>Student Club Hub</h1>
            <p>
            A project developed by the Senior Software Engineering Class at Walsh University
            in the spring of 2020. The project was developed using the Vue.js framework and
            caused the team to adapt to develop remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
            The goal of this website is to help students find new clubs
            and to create a centralized place where students can view club activities.
